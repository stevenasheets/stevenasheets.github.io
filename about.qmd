## About this blog

My name is Steven Sheets. I'm a physicist and data scientist working for the semiconductor equipment manufacturer Lam Research. Previously I spent a number of years as a staff physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory working in national security and nuclear physics. I'm fond of climbing rocks & playing around in the Range of Light.

This blog mostly serves as a repository of interesting information for myself. If others find anything of interest here, all the better.
