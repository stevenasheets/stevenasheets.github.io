    "text": "Notes on The Future is Degrowth\n\nby Matthias Schmelzer; Andrea Vetter; Aaron Vansintjan\nSome notes I’ve compiled while reading The Future is Degrowth.\n\n\nWhat is Degrowth?\nThe word ‘degrowth’ seems to bring up images of economic austerity. The authors bristle at this interpretation and instead provide this definition:\n\n“degrowth can be defined as the democratic transition to a society that – in order to enable global ecological justice – is based on a much smaller throughput of energy and resources, that deepens democracy and guarantees a good life and social justice for all, and that does not depend on continuous expansion”\n\nThis should be not be compared to Green New Deal policies that use government spending to hasten the transition to more environmental friendly technologies while remaining compatible with economic growth.\nLater in the first chapter the authors continue to try and distances the degrowth movement from austerity:\n\n“Degrowth is the opposite of recession: recessions are unintentional, while degrowth is planned and intentional; recessions make inequality worse, degrowth seeks to reduce it; recessions typically lead to cuts in public services while degrowth is about de-commodifying essential goods and services; recessions often cause bold policies for sustainability to be abandoned for the sake of restarting growth, while degrowth is explicitly for a rapid and decisive transformation”\n\nwith the idea is that degrowth will be radicially redistributitve:\n\n“By contrast, degrowth targets the assumption that it is economic growth that we need and focuses instead on a radical redistribution of income and wealth, on global justice, and on what actually ensures well-being. While austerity increases inequality by thrashing public services and benefitting the rich, degrowth policies focus on democratizing production, curbing the wealth and over-consumption of the rich, expanding public services, and increasing equality within and between societies.”\n\nSo degrowth aims to both reduce global inequality and solve the climate & ecological problem with a planned and democratic transition away from economic growth. The problem for me is this already sounds utopian. My concern is what specific policies degrowthers are proposing and how are they going to convince people to enact those policies? I am less interested in the degrowth critque of growth because I do not think criticism of growth alone is justification for their proprosed program. Chapters 2 and 3 are critiques of growth so I will skip those chapters and focus my review on what the authors propose and how they plan on getting there.\n\n\nHow will we degrow?\nIn Chapter 5 the authors finally get around to laying out policies they envision for acheiving a degrowth society. Industries that are ecological destructive (oil & gas) and deemed ‘useless’ (advertising, fast-fashion, private space flight, the military etc) should be eliminated. A wealth tax would be levied and caps on the highest incomes will be set. Work will be transformed too so most people only work part-time. To avoid a reduction in living standards from reduced working hours some type of universal basic income will be passed. Public services like housing, health care, and transportation will be increased. Community ownership of things like tools, washing machines, and vehicles rather than individual ownership will be encouraged. To combat global inequity the authors argue for a wealth transfer from the first world to the global south. Meanwhile, throughtout all of this, the authors want increased democratization with workers and communities having a greater voice at all levels of society.\nNow that we have something concrete from the authors it is fun to think through the consequences of such policies. Let’s start with oil and gas. Cutting these out will cause the mother of all energy crisis leading to reductions in employment, inflation, and most likely a recession. Unemployment will be further exacberrated by cuts in other “useless” industries such as the military, advertizing, etc. But don’t fear, the authors want a universal basic income (UBI) to help stave off unemployment.\nBut at what level? The median income in the US is 31k dollars, a UBI given to 300 million Americans at the median income requires $9.3 trillion in revenue to support–far higher than the 4 trillion in revenue recieved by the US government in FY2021. Maybe halving the UBI and allowing only about a third of citizens to receive it would be reasonable making the cost to the government 1.5 trillion.\nA UBI by itself will be a significant government expediture but we also want to provide universal healthcare & massive investments in infrastructure. How will we pay for this? Futhermore, spending buckets of money leads to growth–something we’re specifically trying to avoid.\nTaxing wealth is one way suggested to pay for the degrowth economy. But we’re committed to a no growth scenario while placing a cap on income limits. So the revenue from taxing wealth is a finite revenue stream garanteed to decrease every year (and maybe drastically if there’s significant capital flight out of the country).\nDeficit spending doesn’t look promising either. Creating debt to pay for public services for a no-growth or shrinking economy will mean interest on that debt will blow up. In time servicing the interest on the debt will start crowding out the things you want to spend money on.\nThe authors also want to expand voice of the people by increased democraticization at all levels of society. This doesn’t make a lot of sense to me if the goal is to quickly reshape society and build a ton of new infrastructure. Local interests will often stonewall projects for the greater good if they feel it doesn’t align with their interests (the housing affordibility crisis in California is a great example of this). How are you going to prevent this? Steamrolling community groups if they don’t align with degrowth policies seems contrary to the idea of increased democraticization.\nOn top of the challenges of financing a degrowing economy the authors want to provide reparations to the Global South. The challenges of shrinking an economy and growing social provisioning systems without immiserating everyone already seems substantial. Under these conditions what money is there to provide reparations to the global poor?\nI guess the big question I have is:\n\n\nWho wants this?\nTo me it seems the appeal of Marxist movements was the promise of reducing the inequality in society by equalizing the material standards between the classes. Whether right or wrong the working class saw Marxism as a means to improve their living standards. Degrowth seems to turn this upside down; it promises first world workers an equalization not with the upper class of their society but with the global poor. Degrowthers seem to think offering greater public services will offset the lower living standards they promise. But I see no reason why the public should not be suspicious that degrowthers can deliver on their promises or even why they might want to make that trade-off to begin with.\nReading chapters 6 and 7 I have no confidence the authors have any idea how to pitch these ideas beyond the academic-activist class degrowth lives in. The solutions offered include autonomous collectives, radical progressive taxation, and activities such as what you already see in groups like the Extinction Rebellion. Basically the authors’ solutions appear to keep doing the things progressive socialists are already doing. And we know how well this has been working out for them, right?\nOne of the critiques degrowthers frequently make is there is no way the decoupling between CO2 emissions and economic growth is going to happen fast enough to avoid significant global warming. In my view, this seems partially true but the sting of this criticism loses its edge when you ask when are the top 20 or whatever carbon emitting countries going to adopt a degrowth economy? Oh ya, there is no timeline because none of the large economies are pursuing degrowth policies.\nReading The Future is Degrowth and other degrowth academic literature my sense is the whole program is simply an academic circle-jerk. As degrowth has no standing on any policy front there is no opportunity to study the efficacy of any given policy. So much of the literature comes off to me as vague and handwavy as academics theorize away unburdened by the possibilty of analzying what works in the real world."

    "text": "Jason Hickel has a recent paper with co-author Jefim Vogel. The thrust of the paper is that an absolute decoupling of emissions from GDP growth is too slow to meet the Paris Agreement goals:\n\nIt is not enough to just reduce emissions by any amount; countries need to reduce their emissions to net zero, and fast enough to limit global warming to 1·5°C or at least well below 2°C in an equitable manner, as per the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Insufficient emission reductions will result in dangerous and possibly catastrophic global warming and exacerbate climate injustice. Such a scenario cannot be considered green. Several studies have established that the benchmark for green growth should therefore not just be about whether countries achieve absolute decoupling, but whether they achieve sufficiently rapid absolute decoupling to meet Paris climate and equity commitments.5, 7, 15 It is ultimately a question of speed.\n\nThe paper then argues for post-growth policies in light of the failure of green growth.\nHaving argued that the speed of emissions reductions is important–and finding green growth policies deficient–Hickel and Vogel do not apply the same standard to their preferred degrowth policies. For if you hold degrowth as a solution to environmental problems (in their case, meeting the Paris Agreement goals) then it is insufficient to just criticize green growth, you have to actually show degrowth policies will be implemented in a time-frame commensurate with limiting warming to 1·5°C. Because if you have a policy that no one wants–and have identified Green Growth as unworkable, then we now have two policies that will not acheive the stated goal.\nDegrowth is a great example of the Underpants Gnome theory of political economy. The degrowth version goes like this:\n\nCritique capitalism, colonialism, eco-modernism, and all the other bad -isms.\n????\nRadical social transformation to full blown luxury eco-socialism.\n\nIt seems like if you’re selling Phase 3 as a solution to environmental problems Phase 2 should probably be fleshed out a bit. But when I read popular books and academic papers about degrowth the “how” of this radical social transformation is the most vaguely described. Faced with the problem of moving people towards a radical social transition degrowthers fall into abstract discussions with papers full of words such as “reimagining” or “reconceptualize” but giving little reason why anyone would want to go along with their vision.\nThis can be seen by looking at concrete policy proposals of Hickel and Vogel:\n\nPolicy makers can take several steps toward this end: shifting away from economic growth as a core objective, and instead prioritising equity, human wellbeing, and ecological sustainability;40, 41, 57, 58, 59 scaling down energy-intensive or carbon-intensive and less-necessary forms of production and consumption (eg, sports utility vehicles, air travel, industrial meat and dairy, fast fashion, weapons, cruises, mansions, and private jets);43, 44, 45, 51 reducing income and wealth inequality, and curtailing the purchasing power and consumption of wealthy classes (eg, via wealth taxes and maximum income thresholds);54, 60, 61, 62 insulating buildings and repurposing buildings to minimise new builds;42, 51, 52, 63 reducing food waste, and shifting to agroecological farming techniques and predominantly plant-based diets;51, 64, 65, 66 introducing laws to end planned obsolescence, lengthen product lifespans, and guarantee rights to repair;42, 51, 67 shifting away from private cars while also improving public transit, bike systems, and walkability;42, 51, 68 and shifting from commodified for-profit provisioning to decommodified, socially and ecologically beneficial not-for-profit provisioning.69, 70\n\nThings like air travel, meat & dairy, private car ownership, SUVs and large houses are quite popular across political parties. I imagine anyone who campaigns on the proposal of making everyone vegetarian is simply going to mocked into electoral irrelevance. But it’s worse than that, this paper argues that under degrowth the average American’s income would look far more like the average Nigerian’s:\n\nAccording to the 1.5 °C scenario, all industrialized countries will have their GDP per capita reduced with over 90%. Semi-developed countries such as Argentina, Russia or China will also have their mean incomes severely reduced, with close to 90%. Even developing countries such as India and Kenya will have their GDP reduced with 30 to 4%, while only the group of least developed countries would be allowed a small economic growth – much smaller than their current growth rates, however.\n\n\n\n\nA rainbow near Sawmill Campground."

    "text": "If you’re in the sciences and have done any computational work in the last 30 or so years you’ve likely used (and perhaps blantantly copied material from) William H. Press’ book Numerical Recipes in Scientific Computing. Besides helping countless scientists numerically solve differential equations the main author Press, a theoretical astrophysicist by training, has had an interesting career with interactions with many big names in physics, the defense industry, and government. More Than Curious is Press’ autobiography detailing his successful ascent in academic (astro)physics, becoming a defense consultant, a National Labs administrator, and his final return to academia.\nFor me More Than Curious is an entertaining read not only because of the professional overlap Press & I had through the national labs but also his frank assessments of many big name scientists of the late 20th century. Press did his PhD at Caltech under Nobel Prize winner Kip Thorne working in numerical relativity. The numerical bits of his work he picked up from stinces at Lawrence Livermore National Lab from the likes of Jim Wilson and other LLNL scientists working on weapon design codes. Press raised quickly in the academic ranks becoming–at the time–one of the youngest tenured professors at Harvard. His student Adam Riess would win the Nobel Prize for providing evidence for expansion of the universe.\nAs Press hit mid-career he became increasingly involved in various consultancy roles, most notably the JASONs. The slowest part of his book was his description of the academic politics he experienced as a Harvard professor. I’ve always thought academic politics seemed tedious so I guess that is an upside to never being at the level to be considered for an academic appointment. Press eventally tired of the academic game as well and in the late 1990s accepted a Deputy Director position at Los Alamos National Lab. Press’ half a decade at LANL coincided with a series of interesting events including the Wen Ho Lee scandal, the Cerro Grande fire, and the ousting of the well-liked LANL director John Browne (one of my academic brothers) to be replaced by universally hated Pete Nanos. Press eventually left LANL for a professorship at UT-Austin.\nThe best parts of the book are his anecdotes and assessments of other people.\nHaving spent years at LLNL this bit about how need-to-know worked in practice amused me (this would get you in trouble today!):\n\nCoincidentally, I knew a lot about the neutron bomb. I had visited Livermore Lab two weeks before the Post article came out. Larry Smarr was there consulting with the Jims, Wilson and LeBlanc, on his general relativity computer program. Larry avoided all classified work, but he held a security clearance, because you couldn’t use the Livermore computers otherwise. The two of us were in LeBlanc’s office. “Well, what weapons are you working on?” I asked LeBlanc. Larry cringed. He hadn’t learned that Livermore people loved to talk about their work and ignored need-to-know rules if you expressed the slightest interest. Soon, LeBlanc was drawing diagrams on the board and explaining all manner of clever weapons designs, including, as it happened, the neutron bomb.\n\nYakov Zel’dovich has always fascinated me for the wide breadth of physics he contribued to. Here Press relates a meeting between one my former collaborators, George Chapline, and Zel’dovich:\n\nChapline, still at Livermore, was by then working mostly on astrophysics, and he was in Moscow for an international conference. Zel’dovich caused an inter- mediary to make contact with George and make arrangements for the two of them to meet privately. In the U.S.S.R., this usually meant outdoors and in motion. “Walks in the woods,” were not just metaphorical. It was clear that each knew a lot about the other’s weapons work via classified intelligence sources on their respective sides. Chapline returned from Moscow full of scientific and anecdotal information about the development of Soviet nuclear weapons. It was old, historical stuff—nothing that would then be useful to the United States in any competitive way—but it was surely still technically classified, both in the U.S. and certainly the U.S.S.R. Chapline was willing to talk about the scientific particulars only behind the fence at Livermore. The most likely interpretation was that Zel’dovich wanted intellectual credit—including in the West, including behind our fences— for his nuclear weapons discoveries. He was a loyal Soviet, a hero. But apparently he trusted Chapline to share his information only with members of this one peculiar world brotherhood—nuclear weapons designers on the two sides of the Iron Curtain.\n\n\nZel’dovich may also have wanted to take Sakharov’s reputation down a notch. The latter had by then been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and was a hero in the West. Zel’dovich told Chapline that he, Zel’dovich, ran the whole hydrogen bomb effort, a reality not appreci- ated in the West. Sakharov, a young student, played a very limited role, he said. Zel’dovich did credit him with suggesting what in the West was referred to as “the Teller-Ulam trick”. Lev Landau’s role, in charge of the computational effort, was, Zel’dovich said, much more significant.\n\nI was taught astrophysics by a professor who briefly worked with Zel’dovich. My professor described Zel’Dovich as someone who would take credit for a discovery no matter how vague & hand-wavy Zel’dovich’s initial argument was.\nPress was a fan of Feynman and had some good interactions with him:\n\nFeynman had announced in class that he was going to give individual oral final exams to every student—ten minutes each. What kind of exam could take just ten minutes? “Mr. Press?” he said leaning out of his office when I arrived at four on the dot. I went in. He shut the door. “Now the spider has caught the fly,” his amusement at this joke undiminished on its fourteenth repetition. I stood at the blackboard, and he asked the first question. When I got five words (and one or two chalk symbols) into my answer, he interrupted with the next question. Then similarly for the third. I complained that he was not letting me actually answer the questions. “Oh, you think I don’t know exactly what you were going to say?” He got up from his chair with a sarcastic show of effort and went to the blackboard. “You were going to say this…and then this…and then this.” He was exactly right. After that, I decided to relax and just enjoy not answering the questions. At the end, he said, offhandedly, “You get a B.” He must have seen my disappointment, because he added. “It’s not an ordinary B. It’s a Dick Feynman B. You go out there and be proud of it.”\n\nKip Thorne admonishing Press for having too many non-science interests amused me too:\n\nKip estimated that I worked—actually worked on my research— about three hours a day. I objected: I thought it was three hours a day for nine months of the year, but 16 hours a day for the three months in total that I might have my teeth sunk into a good problem. That’s just it, he said in frustration: The proportions ought to be the reverse. A good scientist could have at most one outside interest. His was sex, he said with a completely straight face. If mine was TV, he could accept that. But no, TV was just one of many other competing interests for me.\n\nThere’s too much quotable material in the book but a free copy of the book is available on Press’ website."
